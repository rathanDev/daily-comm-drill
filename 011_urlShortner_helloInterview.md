Functional Requirements

The first thing you want to do when starting a system design interview is 
to get a clear understanding of the requirements of the system. 

Functional requirements are the features that the system must have to satisfy the needs of the user.

In some interviews, the interviewer will provide you with the core functional requirements upfront.
In other cases, you'll need to determine these requirements yourself. 
If you're familiar with the product, this task should be relatively straightforward. 
However, if you're not, 
it's advisable to ask your interviewer some clarifying questions to gain a better understanding of the system.
The most important thing is that you zero in on the top 3-4 features of the system and don't get distracted by the bells and whistles.
We'll concentrate on the following set of functional requirements:
Core Requirements
Users should be able to submit a long URL and receive a shortened version.
Optionally, users should be able to specify a custom alias for their shortened URL.
Optionally, users should be able to specify an expiration date for their shortened URL.
Users should be able to access the original URL by using the shortened URL.
Below the line (out of scope):
User authentication and account management.
Analytics on link clicks (e.g., click counts, geographic data).

If you want, I can **also make an answer key** where each answer is the **exact sentence from your text**, so you can practice repeating them word-for-word.

Do you want me to do that next?
