# Middleware 

Middleware in .NET Core is one of those foundational concepts 
that separates ASP.NET Core from its predecessors
—and gives you full control over the HTTP request pipeline. 
Let’s break it down modularly, with architectural clarity and practical depth.

---

## 🧩 What Is Middleware?

Middleware is a **component** in the ASP.NET Core request pipeline that:

- Intercepts HTTP requests and responses
- Can perform operations **before** and **after** the next component
- Decides whether to **pass the request forward** or **short-circuit** the pipeline

Think of it as a chain of delegates, each with a chance to inspect, modify, or handle the request.

---

## 🔄 Middleware Execution Flow

Imagine this pipeline:

```plaintext
Request → M1 → M2 → M3 → Endpoint
         ← Response ← ← ←
```

Each middleware can:

- Do something **before** calling `next()`
- Call `await next()` to pass control
- Do something **after** the next middleware returns

This enables powerful patterns like logging, exception handling, authentication, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Built-in Middleware Examples

| Middleware               | Purpose                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `UseRouting()`           | Matches request to route               |
| `UseAuthentication()`    | Validates identity                     |
| `UseAuthorization()`     | Enforces access control                |
| `UseStaticFiles()`       | Serves static content                  |
| `UseExceptionHandler()`  | Global error handling                  |
| `UseCors()`              | Enables cross-origin requests          |
| `UseEndpoints()`         | Executes matched endpoint              |

Order matters! For example, `UseRouting()` must come before `UseEndpoints()`.

---

## 🧪 Custom Middleware

You can define your own middleware using either:

### 1. Inline Delegate

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Before");
    await next();
    Console.WriteLine("After");
});
```

### 2. Middleware Class

```csharp
public class MyMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public MyMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Pre-processing
        await _next(context);
        // Post-processing
    }
}
```

Register it with:

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<MyMiddleware>();
```

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each middleware should do one thing well (e.g., logging, auth).
- **Composable**: Middleware should be reusable and chainable.
- **Order-sensitive**: Misordering can break functionality (e.g., auth before routing = fail).

---

## 🧵 Advanced Concepts

- **Terminal Middleware**: Ends the pipeline (e.g., `app.Run(...)`)
- **Short-circuiting**: Middleware can skip calling `next()` to block further processing
- **Branching**: Use `Map()` to route requests to different pipelines
